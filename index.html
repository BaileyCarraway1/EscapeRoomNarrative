  <p>Music People how are we doing today? We will prepare today on Bailey’s Music Crazzyy escape room. I did this escape room for all my music lovers and music singers and rappers I’m going to have you learn and have fun at the same time! Just imagine listening to your favorite song and unscrambled words to find the song. Or also listening to the song or beat and unscrambling the word to guess the song. That’s sounds like a lot of fun if you ask me. The time is 2021 you will be listening to all kinds of genres of music and playing puzzles to figure or guess the song if you already know it. In my escape room you will play six puzzles and they will all have a word at the end of them and at the end of the six puzzles you would have a box to be unlocked with those words and in the box it will tell you what to do. Winners will get Apple Music gift cards and free music for 2 years. Bring on the competition!</p>
